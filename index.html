        <p class="paragraphBorder">Embark on a groundbreaking journey with FluidConnect, where the narrative of hypertext transforms into a dynamic and interconnected exploration of knowledge. Our demo version, a testament to the future of information retrieval, is engineered to build a robust knowledge base from 50 pages of hypertext. This not only enhances the foundation for connecting knowledge but reshapes the way we perceive and interact with information.

          <p>50 page article about XANDADU</p>
          <p>What went wrong with hypertext and by consequence most of modern media? </p>
          <p>In short words?<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything">Everything</a> :) </p> 
          <p>  But first of all the links work only in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction">one direction</a>.</p>
          <p> "Today's popular software simulates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">paper</a>.
            </a>The World Wide Web (another imitation of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=paper">paper</a>) trivialises our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents."</p>
          <p>This is a mission statement of Project Xanadu which was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>. Administrators of Project Xanadu have declared it superior to the World Wide Web.</p>
          <p>The core problem with today's media no matter the form are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news">fake news</a> selective and hard to find sources of information. </p>
      <br><br><br>
  
    <p id="different">This is no different in newest advancements such as LLM GPT's which are known to hallucinate and not focused on fact checking. </p>
      <br><br><br>
    <p id="different2"> The solution would be building a modular system with a base knowledge that could then be displayed to users in various formats. 
  If you want to have a science article, clickbait or instagram caption  it can be brought to you with a help of specialised GPTs.
  When we build this on a solid factual foundation all of these forms of transmitting knowledge could be coherent, interconnected.
  Soon we will be able to invent multi-modal communication tools. This will allow us to translate any input into any type of output. 
  The translation layer will “intertwingle” the information into the knowledge base. </p>
